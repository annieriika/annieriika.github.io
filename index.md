## Introduction

<img src="assets/images/my_photo.jpg" alt="Photo" hspace="20" width="30%" align="right"/> I am a student at the University of Helsinki, set to graduate in the fall semester 2022. Although I started out as an English student, my main interest is in language technology. I have completed courses in english philology, linguistics and language technology. In my free time I love to get creative and take photographs, knit and play piano, as well as enjoy the outdoors by walking, running and hiking. From time to time I also love to travel.
